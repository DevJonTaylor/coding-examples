# Coding Examples
Hello out there.  There are a few examples in different languages.

## Shell Script / Bash Script
### [cli.sh](ShellScripts/cli.sh)
This script was created to allow access to a node script that was used to automate normally performed duties 
like checking version hashes for updates, health checks, unit testing, etc.
 
### [install.sh](ShellScripts/install.sh)
This script was one of my very first.  I created it because I was only able to have one virtual machine on 
my computer.  So I was removing the server and then re-installing it to have different mock server for testing concepts.
This was all before I discovered docker and kubernetes.

## MySQL

### [import.sql](sql/import.sql)
An example of how to import a file using the command line.

## PHP

### [Keygen.sh](PHP/Keygen)
This was a great project.  It involves Object-Oriented Programming, HTTP Requests
 and data handling.  Was a great deal of fun.
